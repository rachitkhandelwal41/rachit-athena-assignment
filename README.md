# Candidate Management System

This is a full-stack application for managing and displaying a list of candidates. It includes a React-based frontend and a backend built with Vite.

## Features

- Search candidates by name or skill.
- Sort candidates by years of experience.
- Fully responsive UI.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or above recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is built using React.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

---

## Backend Setup

The backend uses Vite for building and Node.js for serving the application.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

The backend will be running locally on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified in your code).

---

## Notes

- Ensure the backend is running before testing the frontend to allow API calls to work properly.
- Modify the `API URL` in the frontend code if the backend runs on a port other than `3000`.
